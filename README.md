Observability data comes in the form of ***logs, metrics and traces***.
The collection and storage of observability data is handled by observability backends and agents.
AIOps helps makes sense of this observability data.
[Opni](https://opni.io/) comes with all these nuts and bolts and can be used to self monitor a single cluster or be a centralized observability data sink for multiple clusters.

You can easily create the following with Opni:
* Backends
  - **Opni Logging** - extends [Opensearch](https://opensearch.org) to make it easy to search, visualize and analyze **logs**, **traces** and **Kubernetes events**
  - **Opni Monitoring** - extends [Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io) to enable multi cluster, long term storage for **Prometheus metrics**

* Opni Agent
  - Collects logs, Kubernetes events, OpenTelemetry traces and Prometheus metrics with the click of a button
* AIOps
* Alerting and SLOs

Check out the [docs page](https://opni.io/) to get started!
